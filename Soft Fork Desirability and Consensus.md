## Soft Fork Desirability and Consensus

This aims to be a useful framework for understanding the possible stances in regards to a proposed soft fork, and how to behave accordingly.

As an individual, one needs to answer these two questions to decide what actions to take:
1. Is the proposed soft-fork something that would be good to add to bitcoin?
2. Is there consensus on its desirability?

The answer to question 1 is yes [desirable], no [undesirable], or ambivalent [neutral]. (Ambivalent means you think the pros and cons are even, and are fine with or without it added to bitcoin.)

Question 2 is a strict binary. It’s either yes [consensus] or no [lack of consensus].

This leaves six possible situations. Here’s how one should act given each possible set of conclusions:

||Lack of Consensus|Consensus| 
|:-|:-|:-|
|Undesirable|Oppose any current attempt at activation. Oppose attempts to build consensus.|Bitcoin is in danger of no longer being aligned with your values. Oppose any current attempt at activation. Support attempts to break consensus before activation can happen. If you fail, and then it may be time to leave bitcoin and move on to other endeavors, unless you consider it a minor misalignment.| 
|Neutral|Oppose any current attempt at activation. Neither oppose nor support attempts to build consensus.|Oppose any activation attempts with unacceptable methods. Support activation through your preferred activation method, or whichever acceptable activation method enjoys the most broad support.| 
|Desirable|Oppose any current attempt at activation. Support attempts to build consensus.|Oppose any activation attempts with unacceptable methods. Support activation through your preferred activation method, or whichever acceptable activation method enjoys the most broad support.|
